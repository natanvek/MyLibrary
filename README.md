# MyLibrary

It is a compilation of algorithms for programming competitions that I learned in college or practicing on Codeforces. Most of them were coded from scratch and tested by me in October/November 2023.

There are also Python files to add new functions to the library and to generate JSON objects that can be incorporated as Snippets in VSCode. This way, when adding a function to the library, you select an alias. While coding in VSCode, if you type the selected alias, it pastes the corresponding function from the library. This last feature is especially useful for programming competitions where you need to submit single files containing all the necessary code to solve the exercise.
